          The outer portion or Crown of a tooth is a three-layered structure
          namely â€“ Enamel, Dentin & Pulp.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the tooth decay is limited to the first two layers, it can be
          corrected with Filling/ Restoration. In case the tooth decay reaches
          the third layer and causes inflammation or infection of pulp, an RCT
          or Endodontic Treatment is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Root Canal Treatment also is known as Endodontic Treatment is a
          procedure done when the tooth decay reaches the pulp (innermost layer
          of the tooth) causing inflammation. It is necessary to save the
          damaged tooth from extraction. This procedure is done by an
          Endodontist who is known as a Root Canal Specialist. The procedure
          involves:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Removal of inflamed or infected tooth material</li>
          <li>Cleaning and disinfection</li>
          <li>Filling and sealing with an inert material</li>
          <li>Restoration and crown/cap</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is a multi-step procedure and may require multiple sittings.</p>

        <h1>WHY DOES ONE NEED TO UNDERGO ROOT CANAL TREATMENT?</h1>
        <p>
          Root Canal Treatment is done on a damaged or infected tooth. Infection
          could be due to a cracked or broken tooth, deep decay, gum diseases or
          maybe due to repeated dental treatment on a particular tooth. It
          becomes extremely important to get the Root Canal Treatment as:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            It stops the infection from spreading and will then save the tooth
            from extraction
          </li>
          <li>RCT relieves the pain caused due to inflammation</li>

        <h1>SYMPTOMS</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The most common symptom that one might need Root Canal Treatment is
            a toothache. The pain can range from mild to severe. With time it
            may worsen, and you will feel the pain even when you bite your food.
          </li>
          <li>
            The other reason is prolonged sensitivity. If you feel sensations in
            your tooth while consuming something hot or cold, then there is the
            slightest chance that one needs to undergo Root Canal Treatment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Swelling in the gums can also be a sign that you need Root Canal
            Treatment.

          WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT GETTING A ROOT CANAL TREATMENT?
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the pain you feel goes away, then it does not mean that your
            tooth had healed with time but this indicates that the nerves inside
            the tooth are all dead and the infection has grown manifolds.
          </li>
          <li>
            The bacteria from infection can enter into the tissues of gum and
            jaw which can cause a pus-filled abscess. This can even lead to a
            serious condition like heart disease and stroke.

        <h6>Step 1:</h6>
        <p>
          Root Canal Treatment is done on a damaged or infected tooth. Infection
          could be due to a cracked or broken tooth, deep decay, gum diseases or
          maybe due to repeated dental treatment on a particular tooth. It
          becomes extremely important to get the Root Canal Treatment as:
        </p>
        <h6>Step 2:</h6>
        <p>
          The next step is Cavity Preparation. A cavity is prepared, making sure
          all the infected tooth material or previous filling material is
          removed and a proper approach to inner-part of the tooth (pulp) is
          established.
        </p>
        <h6>Step 3:</h6>
        <p>
          This is followed by disinfection and shaping of pulp canals. The
          infected pulp is cleared out completely, canals are shaped and
          cleaned. Thorough disinfection is achieved.
        </p>
        <h6>Step 4:</h6>
        <p>
          Clean and disinfected canals are then sealed and filled with an inert
          rubber-like filling material known as Gutta-Percha.
        </p>
        <h6>Step 5:</h6>
        <p>
          The very last step is restoration & crown. The crown portion of the
          tooth cavity is then restored with a filling, followed by a Cap/Crown
          cementation.

        <h1>POST-TREATMENT CARE FOR ROOT CANAL TREATMENT</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Do not put pressure on the tooth. Since there is no crown, the tooth
            is unprotected as a result, putting pressure can cause damage to the
            tooth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid hard and crunchy food, instead chew soft food until final
            restoration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be careful while brushing. Do not be too harsh while brushing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Get a dental crown as soon as possible as this will protect your
            tooth from further damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Visit your dentist if you face any complexities or severe pain.

                can spread to other areas of your jaw causing serious pain.
